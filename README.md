Just Another Android (native) Sound Library
It's ironic, because there aren't any others...

Why?
____
Because I wanted to implement some simple audio in my fully-native Android app and nothing
seemed to be available apart from a bunch of C examples that were overly complicated
and didn't have the functionality I wanted. Hence JAASL.
